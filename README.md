# CUDA Monte Carlo Pi Estimation

This project is a high-performance implementation of the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of Pi using NVIDIA's CUDA platform.

## Description

The program simulates throwing darts at a 1x1 square board that contains a quarter circle with a radius of 1. The ratio of darts that land inside the circle to the total number of darts thrown is used to estimate the area of the quarter circle (Ï€/4), which is then used to calculate Pi.

The simulation is parallelized across thousands of GPU threads to generate billions of random points, leading to a highly accurate estimation of Pi in a short amount of time.

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you will need:
1.  An **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support.
2.  The **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit** (v12.x recommended).
3.  **Visual Studio 2022** (or 2019) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload installed.

## Results
